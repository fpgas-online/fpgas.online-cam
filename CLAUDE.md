## Background

This repo is part of the [fpgas.online](https://fpgas.online) FPGA-as-a-Service platform.
The platform provides remote access to real FPGA boards (Arty A7, NeTV2, Fomu, TinyTapeout)
via PoE-powered Raspberry Pis that are network-booted.

This codebase was extracted from the original monorepo [`carlfk/pici`](https://github.com/CarlFK/pici)
in April 2026 using `git filter-repo` to preserve commit history. The monorepo was split into
purpose-specific repos under the `fpgas-online` GitHub organization, where each repo produces
installable artifacts (pip packages or deb packages) consumed by the infrastructure repo.

## Repository Overview

Camera capture and GStreamer streaming scripts installed on Raspberry Pi boards.
Streams live video from Pi cameras to the fpgas.online server so users can watch
their FPGA designs running on real hardware.

### Packaging

Built as a `.deb` package via nfpm (`nfpm.yaml`). Published to the fpgas.online
apt repo at https://fpgas-online.github.io/apt.

The deb installs scripts to `/usr/local/bin/` and a systemd service to
`/usr/lib/systemd/system/fpgas-cam.service`.

### Deployment

Installed on Pis by the infra repo's `cam/pi` ansible role via `apt install fpgas-online-cam`.
The server-side nginx-rtmp/HLS streaming config lives in the infra repo (Jinja2 templates
with host-specific variables).

## Conventions

- **Python**: Use `uv` for all Python commands (`uv run`, `uv pip`). Never use bare `python` or `pip`.
- **Dates**: Use ISO 8601 (YYYY-MM-DD) or day-first formats. Never American-style month-first dates.
- **Commits**: Make small, discrete commits. Each logical unit of work gets its own commit.
- **License**: Apache 2.0.
- **Linting**: All repos have CI lint workflows. Fix lint errors before pushing.
- **No force push**: Branch protection is enabled on main. Never force push.
